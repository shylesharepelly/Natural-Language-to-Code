## Training and Testing
1. first you need to install the python libraries 
libraries:
- numpy
- json
- keras
- tkinter


2. After installing the libraries you can run file train.py to train the model 
```py
  python train.py
```

3. it will create a model and use this model in test.py file to give input to model and model will predict the c language code.

```py
python test.py
```

Alternatively , you can download my model from huggingface and use it

Instead of training a model from scratch , i have finetuned phi-2 model which is trained on large amount of data, you can find the code in google colab
